Displays your Issuu-hosted catalog of PDF files in your wordpress posts/pages using a shortcode.

== Description ==

<a href="http://issuu.com" target="_blank">Issuu.com</a> is a great place to host your PDF magazines, but you'd rather keep your visitors on your site then send them over, right?

Issuupress fetches (via the Issuu API) a list of all your PDFs hosted on issuu.com and allows you to display that list on your blog via a simple shortcode.

You can optionally restrict the list by tag, and control the issuu viewer via shortcode attributes.

You will need credentials to access the issuu API: login to issuu and access <a href="http://issuu.com/services/api/" target="_blank" title="issuu api">http://issuu.com/services/api/</a>Â to find your own API key and key secret.

Please <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/issuupress/">rate the plugin</a> if you like it.
Thanks,

= Usage = 
Simply put the `[issuupress]` shortcode where you would like the catalog to be. Add attributes to customize it.

Example: 
`[issuupress tag="" viewer="mini" titlebar="false" vmode="" ctitle="Pick a PDF file to read" height="480" bgcolor="FFFFFF"]` 

To customize its appearance, use your theme's CSS style.css file.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file 
2. Drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation 
3. Activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
4. Go to Settings > IssuuPress, enter your API key and API secret, set the cache value.
5. Use the shortcode wherever you see fit. To customize its appearance, use your theme's CSS style.css file.

= Example = 
`[issuupress tag="" viewer="mini" titlebar="false" vmode="" ctitle="Pick a PDF file to read" height="480" bgcolor="FFFFFF"]` 

= Options =

- **tag=""** :  If you want, you can restrict the list to only pdf with the provided tag. Default: ""
- **viewer="mini"** : Possible values: "no","mini","presentation" or "window". Default: "mini".
- **titlebar="false"** : Displays the PDF's titlebar. Possible values: "true", "false". Default: "false".

== Changelog ==

- woops. A few quirks got left behind.
